    <p>
      My initial reaction when interacting with the Downstream interface was the
      density of options on the page and the utilisation of webpage space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the span of 2 minutes, my focus when exploring the website could be comprised of 4 different interactions.
       <!-- Use a list to section the different interactions-->

      <ol type ="1">
<li>Pressed the on/off button</li>
<li> Hovered over everything to see the locations of each button</li>
<li> Interacted with the memory minigame </li>
<li> Increased the difficulty of the memory minigame</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>The majority of my time was spent with the memory minigame and experiencing the optional increase in difficulty. This was due to the activity being the 
      main focus of the website and having the option to increase the difficulty allowed me to spend more time on the game. </p>

    <p>My most common action was pressing the symbols that were involved with the memory minigame. As the game offered 11 different interactable buttons,
      I easily spent the majority of my time pushing those buttons. As such, pushing those buttons was my most common action.   </p>

    <p>My impression of the web page's primary goal is that the creators wanted to hook people by presenting an engaging interface and allowing them to have fun within the confines of the website.
       From here, the users would be interested in seeing more work from the site creator via the social links provided at the top right area of the page.</p>

    <p>As the interface was engaging and kept me interested for a decent period, I would say that the goal was communicated well. The main draw of the minigame
      left me fixated on the page, wondering what more the website and its developers could offer.  </p>

    <p>The experience should be experienced multiple different times. This is due to the repeatable nature of the memory minigame and the different options to increase or decrease difficulty.
       Although, as this is the main draw of the site, a user should only spend around 5-10 mins on it. </p>

    <p>The site encourages multiple repeat interactions through text that prompts the user to engage continuously with the memory minigame. This is further exemplified
      throguh the use of bright orange text that is targed towards what the user is interacting with.  </p>

    <p>The experience references digital video through the use of the virtual camera, displaying a video game village.
       Video is also utilised to present text and a virtual face that incentivises the user to remain on the website by using text to communicate
       to the user. </p>

    <p>These references communicate that I should compare this experience to that of a video game. 
      The presence of a cartoonish aesthetic and game to play further denotes the idea of a video game. As such, I should act as I would within a video game. </p>

    <p>The video game references communicate that I should be feeling a sense of enjoyment or fun when interacting with the site. The cartoonish aesthetic combined with 
      each button feeling like a video game asset further enhances the feeling of enjoyment.</p>

    <p>The most frustrating part of the experience was the lack of additional activities after experiencing the memory minigame. Features such as the robot face, cartoon styled camera and flowing text,
    enhanced the experience that I enjoyed, but didn't provide additional activity for me to do. </p>

    <p>The most satisfying part of the experience was the colour palette. The utilisation of chrome on bright orange made interaction with the buttons very satisfying and incentivised me to continue to interact
      with the website. I also enjoyed a sense of accomplishment frmo beating the increased challenges of the memory minigame. </p>
