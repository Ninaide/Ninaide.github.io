/* For the style of each of the coloured boxes, I opted for a simple square design
as I felt it would best match the square boarders for the animal images. The
design aims to make the task feel more obvious at a glance, ensuring that the
user doesn't overthink or overcomplicate the activity.  */

/* My main inspiration for the design came from a website called CoughDrop (https://app.mycoughdrop.com/melissad/google-animal-sounds_1). They utilise simple 
animal images that, when pressed, make the appropriate animal sound. Rather than do the same, I opted for using 
these simple design choices and having the images be draggable rather than stationary. */

  /* For the background of the page, I opted to go for a washed out look, using a very 
  light green for the colour of choice. I wanted to use a colour rather than a neutral such
  as black or white as I felt that having a neutral colour for the background would feel less playful
  in design. Having any sort of colour adds a more playful and cheery atmosphere on the page. Having
  a washed out colour also helps by not being overwhelming or distracting to the user and doesn't hide 
  any of the important coloured boxes on the right side of the screen. */

/* For the sizing of the animal images and the coloured boxes, I aimed to make them relatively equal sizing
 so that the overall design isn't jaring. This meant experimenting with width and height, mainly for 
 the animal images, until I was satisfied with the outcome. While I am happy with how the sizing turned out,
 unfortunately since not all of the animal images are an equal square shape, it doesn't perfectly fit over
 the coloured squares. While I could make the boxes more accurately match the shape of the animal
 images, I feel as though that would take away some of the purpose of the activity. Having the coloured 
 boxes match the shapes of the animals would negate the purpose of having sound as a user would be able
 to match the animals purely based on the coloured box shape, which is not what I want to go*/

aim was to give the activity more life and expression, hence using these

Initially, I didn't want to have the boxes coloured that hinted towards the correct animal. However,
I decided that I would include it to give the coloured boxes more meaning rather than having them 
be simple placeholders for animal images.      */
