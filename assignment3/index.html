    <!-- I have begun the project by creating 5 different animal images. Each image is draggable and can be placed 
     onto each box on the right side of the screen. Every animal image was drawn up by me to avoid anyh liscencing 
     or copyright issues. -->

     <!-- The crude and cartoonish style of each animal is intended to give the idea that this is 
      primarily for a younger demographic. The aim of this style is to give off a friendly demeanour, resulting
      in the audience being more engaged with the activity.-->
    <div class="container">
      <!-- To avoid the most confusion with my code, I have grouped the animal images, seen on the left side
       of the screen, into an image container so that styling them with a style sheet (using CSS) is easier. They
       are seperated from the boxes on the right side of the screen to avoid cluttering and confusion with the 
       activity.-->
      <div class="image-container">
        <!-- Each image icon uses a png format making them easy to work with. While they do contain more data
         than using a jpg format, the image size is relatively small and won't affect how the website runs 
         in a vastely negative way. -->

    <!-- Below is the code that visualises the audio portion of the website. Above every box is a button
     that, when clicked, emits an audio that one of the animals (on the left side of the screen) would make.
     It is then up to the user to identify the correct sound and drag the corresponding image to the correct 
     box.-->
