    <!-- I have begun the project by creating 5 different animal images. Each image is draggable and can be placed 
     onto each box on the right side of the screen. Every animal image was drawn up by me to avoid anyh liscencing 
     or copyright issues. -->

     <!-- The crude and cartoonish style of each animal is intended to give the idea that this is 
      primarily for a younger demographic. The aim of this style is to give off a friendly demeanour, resulting
      in the audience being more engaged with the activity.-->
    <div class="container">
      <!-- To avoid the most confusion with my code, I have grouped the animal images, seen on the left side
       of the screen, into an image container so that styling them with a style sheet (using CSS) is easier. They
       are seperated from the boxes on the right side of the screen to avoid cluttering and confusion with the 
       activity.-->
      <div class="image-container">
        <!-- Each image icon uses a png format making them easy to work with. While they do contain more data
         than using a jpg format, the image size is relatively small and won't affect how the website runs 
         in a vastely negative way. -->
        <img src="Dog.png" alt="Image 1" class="draggable" id="dog" />
        <img src="Cat.png" alt="Image 2" class="draggable" id="cat" />
        <img src="Bird.png" alt="Image 3" class="draggable" id="bird" />
        <img src="Frog.png" alt="Image 4" class="draggable" id="frog" />
        <img src="Goose.png" alt="Image 5" class="draggable" id="goose" />
        <!-- Each image was classed as draggable and given respective ids based on the animal type
         (e.g. id="dog" for the dog).-->

    <!-- Below is the code that visualises the audio portion of the website. Above every box is a button
     that, when clicked, emits an audio that one of the animals (on the left side of the screen) would make.
     It is then up to the user to identify the correct sound and drag the corresponding image to the correct 
     box.-->

     <!-- Initially, the plan was to code buttons that would be labelled 'Sound 1' through to 'Sound 5' above each 
      of the coloured boxes. However, I was unable to get my code to properly funcion and allow for the audio to 
      be played on click of the button. As such, I used source tags instead that would use a 'sounds' directory 
      (where all of the animal sounds were located) and have them set up as audio players. While this isn't as ideal, 
      it does work and ultimately gets the idea across despite sacrificing aesthetic over the function. -->
    <div class="box-container">
      <audio controls>

        <!-- Below, where some of the code is hidden, is what the base code would have looked like if I was able
         to get the previous idea using buttons to work.-->

         <!-- For each individual animal sound, I recorded myself mimicing what each of these animals would
          sound like, using a program called Audacity. After recording all of the base sounds, I altered the 
          sounds the better fit the animal. However, I still wanted to stick with a cartoonish aesthetic for each 
          sound, so rather than mimic and create an accurate animal snarl or growl, I opted for creating a 
          more friendly sound. For instance, rather than the dog barking for the audio, the sound that will
          be heard says 'woof' instead. -->
